Write a program that receives info from the console about people and their phone numbers.

Each entry should have a name and a number (both strings) separated by a "-".

If you receive a name that already exists in the phonebook, update its number.

After filling the phonebook, you will receive a number â€“ N.

Your program should be able to perform a search of contact by name and print its details in the format:
"{name} -> {number}".

In case the contact isn't found, print:
"Contact {name} does not exist."
