07 - String Explosion - judge url: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Compete/Index/1740#6


Write a program that reads a string from the console that contains:
    *) Explosions marked with '>'
    *) Immediately after the mark, there will be an integer x, which signifies the strength of the explosion
    *) Any other characters

Your task is to delete x characters, starting after the exploded character ('>').
If you find another explosion mark ('>') while deleting characters, you should add the strength to your previous explosion.
You should not delete the explosion character â€“ '>'.
When all characters are processed, print the final string.


Constraints:
-----------
You will always receive strength for the explosions
The path will consist only of letters from the Latin alphabet, integers, and the char '>'
The strength of the punches will be in the interval [0â€¦9]


______________ Test Data ______________


Input 1:
-------
abv>1>1>2>2asdasd


Output 1:
--------
abv>>>>dasd


Comment 1:
---------
1st explosion is at index 3, with a strength of 1.
We delete only the digit after the explosion character.
The string will look like this: abv>>1>2>2asdasd
2nd explosion is with strength one, and the string transforms to this: abv>>>2>2asdasd
3rd explosion is now with a strength of 2.
We delete the digit, and we find another explosion.
At this point, the string looks like this: abv>>>>2asdasd.
4th explosion is with strength 2.
We have 1 strength left from the previous explosion, and we add the strength of the current explosion to what is left,
which adds up to a total strength of 3.
We delete the next three characters, and we receive the string abv>>>>dasd
We do not have any more explosions, and we print the result: abv>>>>dasd
