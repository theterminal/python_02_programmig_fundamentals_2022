Your first task at your new job is to create a table of the stock in a bakery,
and you really don't want to fail on your first day at work.

You will receive a single line containing some food (keys) and quantities (values).

They will be separated by a single space (the first element is the key, the second â€“ the value, and so on).

Create a dictionary with all the keys and values and print it on the console.
