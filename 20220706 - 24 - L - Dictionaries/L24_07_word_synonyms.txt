Write a program, which keeps a dictionary with synonyms.
The key of the dictionary will be the word.
The value will be a list of all the synonyms of that word.

You will be given a number 'n' – the count of the words.

After each term, you will be given a synonym, so the count of lines you should read from the console is '2 * n'.

You will be receiving a word and a synonym each on a separate line like this:

•	{word}
•	{synonym}

If you get the same word twice, just add the new synonym to the list.

Print the words in the following format:
{word} - {synonym1, synonym2 … synonymN}
