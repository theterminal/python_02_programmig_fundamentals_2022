Create a class Zoo.
It should have a class attribute called __animals that stores the total count of the animals in the zoo.
The __init__ method should only receive the name of the zoo.
There you should also create 3 empty lists (mammals, fishes, birds).

The class should also have 2 more methods:
    •	add_animal(species, name) - based on the species, adds the name to the corresponding list
    •	get_info(species) - based on the species returns a string in the following format:

        "{Species} in {zoo_name}: {names}
        Total animals: {total_animals}"

On the first line, you will receive the name of the zoo.
On the second line, you will receive number 'n'.
On the following 'n' lines you will receive animal info in the format: "{species} {name}".

Add the animal to the zoo to the corresponding list.
The species could be "mammal", "fish", or "bird".
On the final line, you will receive a species.

At the end, print the info for that species and the total count of animals in the zoo.
