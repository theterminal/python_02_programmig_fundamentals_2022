You should also set an owner to None.

The class should have the following methods:

    •	buy(money: int, owner: str)
        o	If the person has enough money and the vehicle has no owner, returns:
            "Successfully bought a {type}. Change: {change}" and sets the owner to the given one

        o	If the money is not enough, return: "Sorry, not enough money"

        o	If the car already has an owner, return: "Car already sold"

    •	sell()
        o	If the car has an owner, set it to None again.

        o	Otherwise, return: "Vehicle has no owner"

    •	__repr__()
        o	If the vehicle has an owner, returns: "{model} {type} is owned by: {owner}".

        o	Otherwise, return: "{model} {type} is on sale: {price}"
