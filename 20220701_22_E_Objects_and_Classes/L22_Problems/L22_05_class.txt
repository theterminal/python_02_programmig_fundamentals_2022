Create a class Class.
The __init__ method should receive the name of the class.
Each class should also have 2 empty lists - students and grades.
Create a class attribute __students_count equal to 22.

The class should also have 3 additional methods:
    •	add_student(name: str, grade: float) - adds the student and the grade in the two lists if there is free space in the class

    •	get_average_grade() - returns the average of all existing grades formatted to the second decimal point (as a number)

    •	__repr__ - returns the string (single line):
        "The students in {class_name}: {students}. Average grade: {average_grade}".

The students must be separated by a comma and a space: ", ".
