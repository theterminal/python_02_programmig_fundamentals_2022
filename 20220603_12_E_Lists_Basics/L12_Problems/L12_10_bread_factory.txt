As a young baker, you are baking the bread out of the bakery. 

You have initial energy 100 and initial coins 100.
You will be given a string representing the working day events.
Each event is separated with '|' (vertical bar): "event1|event2| … eventN"
Each event contains an event name or an ingredient and a number, separated by a dash ("{event/ingredient}-{number}")

•	If the event is "rest":
    o	You gain energy (the number in the second part). Note: your energy cannot exceed your initial energy (100).
        Print: "You gained {gained_energy} energy.". 
    o	After that, print your current energy: "Current energy: {current_energy}.".

•	If the event is "order": 
    o	You've earned some coins (the number in the second part).
    o	Each time you get an order, your energy decreases by 30 points.
        	If you have the energy to complete the order, print: "You earned {earned} coins.".
        	Otherwise, skip the order and gain 50 energy points. Print: "You had to rest!".

•	In any other case, you have an ingredient you should buy. The second part of the event contains the coins you should spend. 
    o	If you have enough money, you should buy the ingredient and print: "You bought {ingredient}."
    o	Otherwise, print "Closed! Cannot afford {ingredient}." and your bakery rush is over.

If you managed to handle all events throughout the day, print on the following 3 lines: 
"Day completed!"
"Coins: {coins}"
"Energy: {energy}"
