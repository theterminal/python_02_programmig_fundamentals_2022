As a good friend, you decide to buy presents for your friends.
Create a program that helps you plan the gifts for your friends and family.

First, you are going to receive the gifts you plan on buying on a single line, separated by space, in the following format:

"{gift1} {gift2} {gift3}… {giftn}"

Then you will start receiving commands until you read the "No Money" message.
There are three possible commands:

    •	"OutOfStock {gift}"
        o	Find the gifts with this name in your collection, if any, and change their values to "None".
        
    •	"Required {gift} {index}"
        o	If the index is valid, replace the gift on the given index with the given gift.
        
    •	"JustInCase {gift}"
        o	Replace the value of your last gift with this one.

In the end, print the gifts on a single line, except the ones with value "None", separated by a single space in the following format:

"{gift1} {gift2} {gift3} … {giftn}"


Input / Constraints:
-------------------
    •	On the 1st line,  you will receive the names of the gifts, separated by a single space.
    •	On the following lines, until the "No Money" command is received, you will be receiving commands.
    •	The input will always be valid.


Output:
------
    •	Print the gifts in the format described above.
