09 - Rage Quit - judge url: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Compete/Index/1740#8


Every gamer knows what rage-quitting means.
It's when you're just not good enough, and you blame everybody else for losing a game - you press the CAPS LOCK key
on the keyboard and flood the chat with gibberish to show your frustration.

Peter is a gamer, a bad one.
When he rage-quits, he wants to be the most annoying kid on his team; he wants something truly spectacular.
He asks for your help.
He'll give you a series of strings (containing only non-numerical characters) followed by non-negative numbers (N), e.g., "a3".
You need to convert the letters to uppercase for each string and print it repeatedly N times on the console.
In the example, you need to write back "AAA".

First, on the output, you should print a statistic of the number of unique symbols used (case-insensitive) in the format:
"Unique symbols used: {0}".

Next, print the rage message itself.
The strings and numbers will not be separated by anything.
The input will always start with a non-numeric symbol, and for each string, there will be a corresponding number.
The input will be given on a single line.


Input
-----
    *) The input data should be read from the console.
    *) It consists of a single line holding a series of string-number sequences.
    *) The input data will always be valid. There is no need to check it explicitly.


Output
------
    *) The output should be printed on the console. It should consist of exactly two lines:
        - On the first line, print the number of unique symbols used in the message in the format described above.
        - On the second line, print the rage message.


Constraints
-----------
    *) The count of string-number pairs will be in the range [1 … 20 000].
    *) Each string will contain any character except digits. The length of each string will be in the range [1 … 20].
    *) The repeat count for each string will be an integer in the range [0 … 20].
    *) Allowed working time for your program: 0.3 seconds. Allowed memory: 64 MB.


_______________ Test Data _____________


Input 1:
-------
a3


Output 1:
--------
Unique symbols used: 1
AAA


Comment 1:
---------
We have just one string-number pair. The symbol is 'a', convert it to uppercase and repeat 3 times: AAA.
Only one symbol is used ('A').


----------------------------------------


Input 2:
-------
aSd2&5s@1


Output 2:
--------
Unique symbols used: 5
ASDASD&&&&&S@


Comment 2:
---------
"aSd" is converted to "ASD" and repeated twice; "&" is repeated 5 times; "s@" is converted to "S@" and repeated once.
5 symbols are used: 'A', 'S', 'D', '&' and '@'.
