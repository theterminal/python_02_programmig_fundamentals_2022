10 - Winning Ticket - judge url: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Compete/Index/1740#9


The lottery is exciting. However, checking a million tickets for winnings only by hand is not.
So, you are given the task of creating a program that automatically checks if a ticket is a winner.

You are given a collection of tickets separated by commas and spaces (one or many).
You need to check each ticket to see if it has a winning combination of symbols:
    *) A valid ticket has exactly 20 characters.

    *) A winning ticket is a valid one, containing one of the symbols '@', '#', '$' or '^' uninterruptedly repeated
       at least 6 times in both halves of the tickets.

    *) In order to win a Jackpot, the ticket should contain the same winning symbol 10 times on both sides

An example of a valid winning ticket:
"Cash$$$$$$Ca$$$$$$sh"

An example of a Jackpot winning valid ticket:
"$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"


Input
-----
The input will be read from the console.
The input consists of a single line containing all tickets separated by commas and one or more white spaces in the format:
"{ticket}, {ticket}, â€¦ {ticket}"


Output
------
Print the result for every ticket in the order of their appearance, each on a separate line in the format:
    *) If the ticket is invalid: "invalid ticket"

    *) If the ticket is valid, but it is not winning: "ticket "{ticket}" - no match"

    *) If the ticket is valid and winning, but not a Jackpot:
"ticket "{ticket}" - {uninterrupted_match_length}{match_symbol}"

    *) It the ticket hits the Jackpot:
"ticket "{ticket}" - {uninterrupted_match_length}{match_symbol} Jackpot!"


Constrains
----------
Number of tickets will be in range [0 ... 100]
