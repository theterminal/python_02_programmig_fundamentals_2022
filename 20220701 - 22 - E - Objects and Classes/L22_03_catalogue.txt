Create a class Catalogue.

The __init__ method should accept the name of the catalogue (string).

Each catalogue should also have an attribute called products, an empty list.

The class should also have three more methods:

    •	add_product(product_name: str) - adds the product to the products' list

    •	get_by_letter(first_letter: str) - returns a list containing only the products that start with the given letter

    •	__repr__ - returns the catalogue info in the following format:

"Items in the {name} catalogue:
{item1}
{item2}
...
{itemN}"

The items should be sorted alphabetically in ascending order.
