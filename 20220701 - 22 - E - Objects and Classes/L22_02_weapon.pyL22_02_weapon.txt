Create a class Weapon.

The __init__ method should receive a number of bullets (integer).

Create an attribute called bullets to store that number.

The class should also have the following methods:

    •	shoot()
        o	If there are bullets in the weapon, reduce them by 1 and return a message "shooting..."
        o	If there are no bullets left, return: "no bullets left"

    •	__repr__()
        o	Returns "Remaining bullets: {amount_of_bullets}"
        o	You can read more about the method here: link
