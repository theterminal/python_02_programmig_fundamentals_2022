Note: Submit only the classes in the judge system for all tasks. Test your classes with your own code to see if they work correctly.


Create a class Storage.

The __init__ method should accept one parameter - the capacity of the storage.
The Storage class should also have an attribute called storage - empty list, where all the items will be stored.

The class should have two additional methods:
    •	add_product(product: str) - adds the product in the storage if there is enough space for it
    •	get_products() - returns the storage list


________ Test Data _________


Input 1 - it is part of the program!!!:
-------
storage = Storage(4)
storage.add_product("apple")
storage.add_product("banana")
storage.add_product("potato")
storage.add_product("tomato")
storage.add_product("bread")
print(storage.get_products())


Output 1:
--------
["apple", "banana", "potato", "tomato"]
