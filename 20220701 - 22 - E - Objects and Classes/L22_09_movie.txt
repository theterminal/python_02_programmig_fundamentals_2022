Create a class Movie.
The __init__ method should receive a name and a director.
It should also have a default value of an attribute called watched set to False.
There should also be a class attribute __watched_movies which will keep track of the number of all the watched movies.

The class should have the following methods:

    •	change_name(new_name: str) - changes the name of the movie

    •	change_director(new_director: str) - changes the director of the movie

    •	watch() - change the watched attribute to True and increase the total watched movies class attribute
        (if the movie is not already watched)

    •	__repr__() - returns "Movie name: {name}; Movie director: {director}. Total watched movies: {__watched_movies}"
