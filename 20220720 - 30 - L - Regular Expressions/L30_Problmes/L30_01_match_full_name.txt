Write a program to match full names from a sequence of characters and print them on the console.

Writing the Regular Expression
------------------------------

First, write a regular expression to match a valid full name, according to these conditions:
    *) A valid full name has the following characteristics:
        - It consists of two words.
        - Each word starts with a capital letter.
        - After the first letter, it only contains lowercase letters.
        - Each of the two words should be at least two letters long.
        - A single space separates the two words.

To help you out, we have outlined several steps:
    *) Use the online regex tester like https://pythex.org/

    *) Check out how to use character sets (denoted with square brackets - "[]")

    *) Specify that you want two words with a space between them (the space character ' ', and not any whitespace symbol)

    *) For each word, specify that it should begin with an uppercase letter using a character set.
       The desired characters are in a range – from 'A' to 'Z'.

    *) For each word, specify that what follows the first letter are only lowercase letters,
       one or more – use another character set and the correct quantifier.

    *) To prevent capturing of letters across new lines, put "\b" at the beginning and at the end of your regex.
       This will ensure that what precedes and what follows the match is a word boundary (like a new line).

To check your RegEx, use these values for reference (paste all of them in the Test String field):


Match all of these:
------------------
Peter Smith


Match none of these:
-------------------
peter smith Peter smith peter Smith PEter Smi7h Peter SmIth


Implementing the Solution
-------------------------
Import re, create your pattern (don't forget to escape the special characters),
and use the findall() method to get all the matches.

Then print them:

# import re
# names = input()
# regex = ""    # TO DO
# matches = re.findall(regex, names)
# print(" ".join(matches))
